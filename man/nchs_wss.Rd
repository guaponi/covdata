The percent of deaths reported in this table are the total number of represent all deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis
and do not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Data are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred
and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. \emph{This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more},
depending on the jurisdiction, age, and cause of death. Provisional counts reported here track approximately 1–2 weeks behind other published data sources
on the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. COVID-19 deaths are defined as having confirmed or presumed COVID-19, and are coded to ICD–10 code U07.1.
Unweighted population percentages are based on the Single-Race Population Estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, for the year 2018
(available from: https://wonder.cdc.gov/single-race-population.html). Weighted population percentages are computed by multiplying county-level population counts by
the count of COVID deaths for each county, summing to the state-level, and then estimating the percent of the population within each racial and ethnic group.
These weighted population distributions therefore more accurately reflect the geographic locations where COVID outbreaks are occurring.
Jurisdictions are included in this table if more than 100 deaths were received and processed by NCHS as of the data of analysis.

Missing values may indicate that a category has between 1 and 9 observed cases and have been suppressed in accordance with NHCS confidentiality standards.
